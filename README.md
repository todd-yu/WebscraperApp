# WebscraperApp

Idea #1: Chrome extension that looks at the article youâ€™re reading, and then intelligently suggests new articles to read (note: we can break the program into more granular steps once we finalize which idea we want to pursue)
Backend
a) Scrape data off of the website the user is correctly on
b) Run scraped data through NLP to extract key terms and identify article topic
c) Using the key terms identified in (b) use ML to identify relevant articles 

Frontend
a) website (pretty basic) where users can adjust settings (ie how many articles to suggest from a given range, maybe you can activate the article suggestion feature using a keyboard command, etc.)
b) actual chrome extension: logo for extension button; how would the articles pop up (maybe miniature views of the article pop up on the bottom right, with title and news source in bigger font)
